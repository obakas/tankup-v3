# TankUp V3 Workflow

## Current Backend Workflow Snapshot

The current backend implements only the delivery execution core:

```txt
CREATED → ASSIGNED → LOADING → EN_ROUTE → ARRIVED → MEASURING → AWAITING_OTP → COMPLETED
```

Current backend workflow notes:

- delivery transitions are server-validated,
- each successful status transition writes a delivery event and audit log,
- OTP generation is allowed in `ARRIVED` and `MEASURING`,
- OTP verification is allowed in `AWAITING_OTP`,
- OTP verification does not automatically complete the delivery,
- `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, and `SKIPPED` are terminal states.

The broader workflows below describe product direction and include features not implemented yet.
