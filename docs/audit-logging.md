# TankUp V3 — Audit Logging

## Purpose

Audit logs protect TankUp from confusion, fraud, and invisible manipulation.

If money, delivery proof, status, disputes, or user access changes, TankUp must know:

- who changed it,
- what changed,
- when it changed,
- why it changed,
- what evidence supported it.

Audit logging is not a luxury feature.

It is operational insurance.

# 1. Core Rule

No admin override should ever happen silently.

No payment change should ever happen silently.

No dispute resolution should ever happen silently.

No suspension should ever happen silently.

---

# 2. Audit Log Structure

# 6. Admin Override Requirements

Any admin override must include:

```txt
entity_type
entity_id
old_status
new_status
reason
admin_id
timestamp
```

Optional but recommended:

```txt
evidence_url
related_incident_id
related_dispute_id
```

---

# 7. Forbidden Audit Behavior

The system should not allow:

- deleting audit logs,
- editing audit logs,
- completing delivery by changing only status,
- refunding payment without reason,
- resolving dispute without resolution summary.

Audit logs should be append-only.

---

# 8. Audit Severity

```txt
low
medium
high
critical
```

Examples:

```txt
LOGIN_SUCCESS = low
DELIVERY_STATUS_CHANGED = medium
PAYMENT_REFUNDED = high
ADMIN_PAYMENT_OVERRIDE = critical
```

---

# 9. Audit Visibility

## Customer Can See

- payment confirmation,
- delivery status history,
- dispute outcome,
- refund status.

## Driver Can See

- assigned delivery status,
- incident submission,
- completion status,
- payout eligibility where applicable.

## Fleet Head Can See

- fleet delivery status,
- tanker status,
- driver incidents,
- payout status.

## Admin Can See

- all audit logs.

---

# 10. Audit Log Retention

MVP:

- store permanently.

Future:

- archive old logs,
- export audit reports,
- filter by actor/entity/date/severity.

# 12. MVP Audit Priorities

Implement audit logs for:

1. Admin overrides.
2. Payment updates.
3. Refunds.
4. Delivery completion.
5. Dispute resolution.
6. User suspension.
7. Site risk changes.

Simple table first.

Fancy dashboards later.
