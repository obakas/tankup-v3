# TankUp V3 Statuses

## Current Backend Delivery Statuses

The current backend `Delivery` model uses these Prisma enum values:

```txt
CREATED
ASSIGNED
LOADING
EN_ROUTE
ARRIVED
MEASURING
AWAITING_OTP
COMPLETED
FAILED
SKIPPED
```

Current happy path:

```txt
CREATED
→ ASSIGNED
→ LOADING
→ EN_ROUTE
→ ARRIVED
→ MEASURING
→ AWAITING_OTP
→ COMPLETED
```

Current terminal states:

```txt
COMPLETED
FAILED
SKIPPED
```

Current implementation notes:

- `COMPLETED` requires prior OTP verification on the delivery record.
- `FAILED` requires a reason.
- `SKIPPED` requires a reason and is only allowed from selected operational states.
- The backend currently tracks `Delivery`, `DeliveryEvent`, `AuditLog`, and `Notification` around this core flow.
- `DeliveryAlert` exists in the Prisma schema, but the current alert detector records alert events/audit logs rather than `DeliveryAlert` rows.
