# TankUp V3 — Domain Boundaries

## Purpose

This document defines what each domain owns, what it can change, what events it emits, and what it must never directly touch.

The goal is to prevent spaghetti architecture.

TankUp V3 is an operational logistics system. Each domain must have clear authority.

---

# Core Rule

A domain should only directly modify data it owns.

If another domain needs to react, use:

- service calls
- workflow engine actions
- domain events
- audit logs
- operational events

Do not let every module update every table.

That is how good systems become village wiring.
